## Hi there, I'm Peng Ju!

I'm a PhD candidate in department of Physics, Purdue University. I work in [Tongcang Li Research Group](https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang/Home). My research focus on nanofabrication, levitated optomechanics, spin qubit and quantum vacuum fluctuations.

I am a big fan of Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have more than 3 years of experience working on machine learning, computer vision and deep learning related projects.
