I have experience of applying machine learning (deep learning, NLP and CV) to both industry projects and self-motivated projects. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/peng-ju)

- Experienced with data analysis, data engineer, image processing, and numerical simulation with python.
- Having a broad knowledge in different machine learning systems. Able to build and apply common machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing algorithms from scratch with python (PyTorch). 
- Familar with state-of-art machine learning algorithms. Able to fine-tune and apply pre-trained models (e.g. from GitHub, Hugging Face).
