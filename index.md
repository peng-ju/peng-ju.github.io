## Hi there, I'm Peng Ju!

I'm a PhD candidate in Physics department at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I contribute to the groudbreaking research in [Tongcang Li Research Group](https://sites.google.com/site/litongcang). My academic journey is characterized by a deep dive into the intriguing realms of nanofabrication, optical levitation, spin qubit and quantum vacuum fluctuations. This exploration has led me to coauthor [13 high-impact papers](https://peng-ju.github.io/publications/), significantly advances our understanding of these cutting-edge topics. Integral to my research are skills in data analysis, numerical simulation, and image processing, which have been crucial in my investigative endeavors.

My enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence (AI) runs parallel to my physics research. With experience covering a broad range of AI disciplines such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and federated learning, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic field. From January to December 2023, I enhanced my expertise through my work with [The Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu/) at Purdue University. There, I contributed to collaborative machine learning projects in partnership with industry giants like [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) and [Howmet Aerospace](https://www.howmet.com/). This experience was instrumental in blending my theoretical knowledge with practical, real-world applications. 

As of December 2023, I have embarked on a new professional journey as an AI Research Scientist Intern at [InfoBeyond Technology](https://infobeyondtech.com/). My role here focuses on the research and development of advanced object detection technology. I am committed to develop innovative solutions that redefine the capabilities of object detection technology and its applications across various domains.
