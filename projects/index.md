I have experience of applying machine learning (deep learning, NLP and CV) to both industry projects and self-motivated projects. 

- Familiar with data analysis, data engineer with python.
- Able to build and apply common machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing algorithms from scratch with python (PyTorch). 
- Able to fine-tune and apply pre-trained models (e.g. from GitHub, Hugging Face).
