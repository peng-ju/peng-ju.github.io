I have experience of applying machine learning (deep learning, NLP and CV) to both industry projects and self-motivated projects. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/peng-ju)

- Experienced with data analysis, data engineer, image processing, and numerical simulation with python.
- Having a broad knowledge in different machine learning systems. Able to build and apply common machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing algorithms from scratch with python (PyTorch). 
- Familar with state-of-art machine learning algorithms. Able to fine-tune and apply pre-trained models (e.g. from GitHub, Hugging Face).

The Data Mine, Purdue University. Graduate Researcher. 2023-01 - 2023-05.
[[link]](https://github.com/peng-ju/Turbine_blade_anomaly_detection)

- Collaborated with Howmet Aerospace. Developed an X-ray image based anomaly detection algorithm for the turbine blades. The algorithm combines image preposessing (OpenCV), fine-tuned pre-trained CNN model, and logistic regression.
